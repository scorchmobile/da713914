Thank you for pre-registering for the Deputize America “Personal Security” APP. You are now closer to protecting yourself and others.

Most of us have felt afraid in situations at some time in our life.  It is now time for us, as Americans, to take control of our own safety.

It is also time for us to go back in time and start assisting each other when in need.  Sometimes assistance may look as simple as walking a college student to their car in the dark.  Other times it may be interrupting a potentially dangerous situation.  We can even locate each other in a natural disaster.

You will be able to know where your families are, following them if they request it and ask for outside assistance from our modern day hero’s “American Deputies”.

The APP will launch in early November and we will let you know the moment it happens.



Welcome to the Deputize America Family!

We will be in touch soon.  The APP will launch this November!



Please share Deputize America.org with your family and friends.  Between all of us … we will make our country Safer!

Thank you again,
Michael Carrigan
